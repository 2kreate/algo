Kattis complexity assignment (9/5):

In the case where N is the number of test cases, I believe the solution to the Beekeeper problem is O(N). Even in the case that N is the number of words in each test case, I believe that the solution is still O(N).

In each scenario, you are only operating on each individual of N a single time, meaning the number of operations is some constant C multiplied by the number of items, or N. 

You can find my solution to the Beekeeper problem in the Kattis folder in this repo.
